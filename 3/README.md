# TTK4147 - Real-time Systems  
##  Exercise - Scheduling

In this exercise you will get to implement and test different scheduling
algorithms on the RPi. Most schedulers can be categorized as being
either preemptive and non-preemptive, you will get to implement
schedulers of both types. Since implementing an actual scheduler is time
consuming, you will be implementing the scheduling algorithms in a
software framework in which artificial "tasks" will be scheduled. The
goal is to emulate the behaviour of a real scheduler. You can find the
framework and one example scheduler in `scheduling.c` and `schedulers.c`. 
It is strongly suggested that you read through these to prepare for the lab.

## Introduction

The framework used for emulating the scheduler is based on the
artificial tasks struct

```c
    struct Task {
        enum taskState state;
        int ID;
        int arrivalTime;
        int startTime;          // Some time unit
        int totalRuntime;       // Some time unit
        int currentRuntime;     // Some time unit
    };
```

which should contain all the information needed by the scheduler. The
`taskState` enumeration contains the states
`{idle, running, preempted, finished}`. We will only consider these
artificial states.

The tasks are run by the `task_handler` function which ensures that each
"task" behaves appropriately and according to its state. Even though the
tasks actually are scheduled by the underlying system, the
`task_handler` function only "runs" when it has the appropriate state.

You can interface and change the state of a task by using the
`set_task_state` function. Do not attempt to otherwise change the values
of the task struct. However, you have full access to reading the values.
You should only edit `schedulers.c` file.

The parameters of the tasks are stored in `tasks.txt` and are 
dynamically loaded.

The round-robin scheduling algorithm is implemented as an illustration.
You can use this as a template when implementing your algorithms. Note
that all preemptive schedulers should run at intervals of 10 time units,
just in the same way as the round-robin scheduler.

#### TASK A

As an introduction to this exercise you should read through
the code before testing it, make sure you understand how it works! Use
the provided `Makefile` to create the executable file. Since the
Raspberry Pi OS does not have clang installed by default, you have to
install it (`sudo apt install clang`). Does the scheduler work as
expected?

You should call the executable `./scheduling <scheduler_type>` where 
scheduler types are FCFS, SPN, RR, HRRN, SRT, and FEED.

You can use `plot.py` script to visualise the results of scheduling stored 
in `log_RR.txt` file, by running 
`python plot.py --log log_RR.txt` if Round-Robin is the scheduler.


#### TASK B

You will now implement three non-preemptive schedulers, namely:

1.  First-Come-First-Served

2.  Shortest Process Next

3.  Highest Response Ratio Next

It is recommended to use the example as a template for your
implementation. As you will see, there are only minor differences
between the schedulers, and large parts of the code can be reused.

Illustrate or write down how you expect the tasks to be run by the
schedulers.

Implement the schedulers.

Test if the schedulers work as expected. Visualize the output using the script.

PS: You can use the diagram on the lecture slides as a reference for
your results, but there might be some slight deviations.

#### TASK C

You will now implement two preemptive schedulers, namely:

1. Shortest Remaining Time

2. Feedback

Illustrate or write down how you expect the tasks to be run by the
schedulers.

Implement the schedulers.

Test if the schedulers work as expected. Visualize the output using the script.
